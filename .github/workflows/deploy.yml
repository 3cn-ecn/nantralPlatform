# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: OVH Deploy

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# This workflow contains 3 jobs.
# webpack and test can run side by side
jobs:
  webpack:
    # Specify which OS we are running our job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # A step can use a GitHub action which is available on the marketplace or simply run a command in the runner's shell.
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
