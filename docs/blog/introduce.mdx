Welcome to Nantral Platform! I'm glad to introduce you to this new website ðŸ¥°

Nantral Platform is a website developped by and for the Centrale Nantes'
students. Its aim is to help students to communicate between each other,
to organize events or simply make some annoucements.

{/* truncate */}

This platform is composed of several parts, called **apps**:

-  **Groups**: there are the core of Nantral Platform. A group can represent
   a club, an association, a flatshare, a class, or anything else. Groups can
   create events or posts so as to share it with all the students.
-  **Event and posts**: this app allows students to access and read events
   and annoucments about Centrale Nantes' life.
-  **Flatshares map**: a map with all the flatshares of the Centrale Nantes'
   students.
-  **The mentoring algorithm**: an algorithm to attribute mentors to new
   students
-  **The students directory**: to find all the students of the school.
-  **The email signature generator**: a tool to build a personnalized
   Centrale Nantes email signature.

We hope you will enjoy the website, and help to improve it!
