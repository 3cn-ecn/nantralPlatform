# History of the Nantral Platform project

Before Nantral Platform came to life, various projects have been created before.

## The Students Server, or "Serveur des Élèves"

The *Students Server* was a server, maintained by students, which had the 
purpose to host different websites of the clubs and associations of the school.
Unfortunately, it was too difficult to maintain and the project ended up
in 2018.

## Hippocéan

Hippocean was a website created to be a directory with all the websites 
related to Centrale Nantes. Its purpose was to give a simple way to find
easily and quickly the website you were looking for.

## The Students Directory, or "Annuaire des Élèves"

The purpose of this project was simply to offer a website to regroup the names
of all the students of the school. It is the main source of Nantral Platform:
our project has been built in continuity with this one.
