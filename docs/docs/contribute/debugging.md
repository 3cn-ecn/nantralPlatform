# Debugging in development

Local issues can be hard to track down. Don't hesitate to **copy paste your issue into Google**, you will likely find an answer there.

Here is a checklist of things you should check if you encounter a problem.

### Basic checklist:

- Are you in your virtual environment?
- Did you install the latest dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`?
- Did you run `npm run dev` to compile the React code?
- Did you apply your migrations?
- Is the server running?
