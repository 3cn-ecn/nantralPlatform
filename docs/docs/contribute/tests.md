# Test your code

After you add some code, you might want to test the entire site to make sure you didn't break other functionnalities. To do so, you first need to install pytest-django using: `python3 -m pip install pytest-django`, and then run `pytest` everytime you want to test your code.

:::warning
It seams that these commands don't work at this moment. 
To test the local website, please use the old way: `python3 manage.py test`.
