# Typing

How to check that the types of our code is correct?

Testing the types of our code is important, because it allows us to detect
errors before they happen. It also allows us to have a better understanding of
the code we are writing!

## On the Back End

We do not have typing for the moment, however you can already take a look at
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to type python.

## On the Front End

It maybe seems obvious: we use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)!

To check the types in all files, simply run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run types
```
