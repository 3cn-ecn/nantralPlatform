# Debugging

Local issues can be hard to track down. Don't hesitate to 
**copy paste your issue into Google**, you will likely find an answer there.

:::tip How to make a good research?
When you have an issue wih your code, do not hesitate to make a research to find
an answer. Multiple people have usually already had the same issue, and found a
solution.

To make a good search however, try yo use **Google** (yes we know it is not the
best on ethics, but the others search engine are very bad with programming
questions), and always ask your question **in english** (every developpers ask
and answer questions in english, this allows to share the knowledge worldwide!).

Here is a checklist of things you should check if you encounter a problem.

### Basic checklist:

- Are you in your virtual environment?
- Did you install the latest dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`?
- Did you run `npm run dev` to compile the React code?
- Did you apply your migrations?
- Is the server running?
