# Run the project

Wow, you've successfully installed the project! ðŸŽ‰

Now, let's see how to start the project each time you want to work on it.

## Updates

When someone else make changes on the project, you have to update your database
on your computer to avoid problems.

-  First, download the last commits on your local branch:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
-  Then, update the dependencies and your database:
   ```bash
   make update
   ```

<details>
<summary>Someone updated the `master` branch, how to rebase my branch?</summary>

If you are working on a branch and someone else updated the `master` branch,
you should rebase your branch on the `master` branch to avoid conflicts.

-  First, download the last commits on your local `master` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull
   ```
-  Then, go back to your branch and rebase it on the `master` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase master
   ```
   If you have conflicts, you have to resolve them and then continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
   If you want to cancel the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```
-  Finally, if you already pushed your branch to GitHub, you have to force push it:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

:::warning
Do **NOT** merge your branch with the `master` branch, always rebase it.
Merging will destroy the commits history of the project and make it harder to
understand for reviewers.

## Run the back end server (Django)

To run the backend, simply go into the `backend` folder and start the server:

```bash
cd backend/
pipenv run start
```

The server will be launched in the background. You can stop the
server at any time by simply pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal.

When you edit a file of the backend, the changes will be automatically
taken into account: no need to relaunch the server.

## Run the front end server (React)

To run the front end, open a second terminal
(you need to keep the django server running), and run these commands:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm run start
```

You can now visit your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
to see the result! ðŸ¥³

:::note Others npm packages
You will notice 2 others packages in the Nantral Platform repo: `docs` and
`email-templates-generator`.

You can read their README.md files to know how to run them. Most of the time,
they share the same commands as the frontend.
