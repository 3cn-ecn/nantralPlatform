# Python

Let's install Python! Python is a very easy-to-learn language, that we
used to serve the website.

## Install Python

:::warning Check the version
Be sure to select the correct version!
You can find the version required for Nantral Platform in the file
[`backend/.python-version`](https://github.com/3cn-ecn/nantralPlatform/blob/master/backend/.python-version).
Currently, we use **Python 3.10**.
:::

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

Download and install the Python version from the
**[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/search?query=python&hl=fr-FR&gl=FR)**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure
to check the **"Add python to the PATH"** option during the installation!

:::caution
MacOS has already python installed, but sometimes it is the Python2 version. Unfortunately, it is not compatible with Python3,
so you have to install both versions side by side. If it does not work the first time, you can find tutorials on
Internet to solve it.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Python should be already installed on your system.
If it is not the case, run in a terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

:::note
If you need to install multiple versions of python,
you can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
:::

</Tabs>

After the installation, check that it works properly:

-  Open a new terminal
-  Type this command and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to run it:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
-  You should see the Python version on a new line: `Python 3.xx`

<details class="caution">
    <summary>The command does not work or the version is not <em>python3.10</em>, what can I do? ðŸ˜­</summary>

Sometimes you can have multiple versions of python installed on your system: in this case, using `python` can refer to
another version of python (for instance, it refers by default to python2 if it is installed).

To avoid this, you can precise which version you want to use by adding the version to the command: try to run
`python` instead of `python3`, to get the correct version, or `python3.7` for example.

Also notice that on Windows, `python` is sometimes replaced by `py` only: in this case, you can precise the version
by runnning `py -3` for example.

**Once you have found the command that works for you, memorize it: in the following, we will always use `python` or
`python3` but you might need to replace it by the command which works for you.**

If the command is still not recognized, try to close and reopen your terminal,
or try to reboot your computer to refresh the available commands.

## Install Pipenv

Pipenv will be our dependency manager, to handle dependencies of the project.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

1. Ensure that `pip` is correctly installed and upgrade it:
   ```
   python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
   ```
1. Then, run this command into **PowerShell** to install `pipenv`:
   ```powershell
   python3 -m pip install --user pipenv
   ```
1. Add the `pipenv` command to your PATH:
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $Env:PATH + ";$($(get-item $(python -m site --user-site)).parent.FullName)\Scripts", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
   ```
1. Close and reopen your terminal to refresh the PATH.
1. Finally let's test the installation:
   ```bash
   pipenv --version
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-lin" label="MacOS/Linux">

1. First, install **pipx** to manage Python applications:
   -  follow the [official instructions here](https://github.com/pypa/pipx?tab=readme-ov-file#install-pipx)
1. Then, install **pipenv**:
   ```bash
   pipx install pipenv
   ```
1. Check **pipenv** is correctly installed, and that it is accessible in the PATH:

   ```bash
   pipenv --version
   ```

<details>
<summary>If **pipenv** is not correctly installed...</summary>

If it does not work, you might need to add `pipenv` to your PATH. To do this,
you will edit your profile configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
At the end of the file, add this line:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin"
```

Close and restart your terminal, and test again to run `pipenv`.
If it still doesn't work, replace the previous line by this one:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(python3 -m site --user-site)"
```

That's it! You finished to install python, congratulations ðŸ¥³
