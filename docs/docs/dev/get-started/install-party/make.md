# Make

Now it's time to install `make`! It is a small command-line tool which will be very
helpful in the following, trust me ;)

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

1. Open **Powershell** and run:
    ```powershell
    winget install GnuWin32.make
    ```
    If the `winget` command does not work, install it from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
2. Add `make` to your PATH:
    ```powershell
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $Env:PATH + ";C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin\", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
    ```
3. Close and restart your terminal, then test the command:
    ```powershell
    make --version
    ```
