# Visual Studio Code

You can use whatever text editor suites you the best, however, we strongly encourage you to use Visual Studio Code as we have
created vscode configuration files to make sure everybody follow the same code style.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win-mac" label="Windows/MacOS">

- Download the latest release of VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Click on the executable you've just downloaded and follow the instructions.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Install the snap package:

```bash
sudo snap install code --classic
```

:::info
If you prefere, Visual Studio Code is also available as a
[flatpak package](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code),
or as a `.deb` package on the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
