# Pick an OS

First of all, you need to pick an OS. You can use any OS, but they all have
their pros and cons.

## Summary

| My situation                                           | The choice we recommend |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| I have a Mac                                           | Use MacOS               |
| I already know Linux or I am interested in learning it | Use Linux               |
| I have a Windows with good performances                | Use WSL                 |
| I have a Windows with very bad performances            | Use Github Codespaces   |

## Pros and cons of each OS

### Linux

✅ Pros: it is perfect for web development, as a Unix-based system.
It is also free, installable on any computer, you can dual-boot it with Windows,
and it has a lot more tools for devs than Windows or MacOS.

❌ Cons: you will need to learn how to use it, and it is not as user-friendly
as Windows or MacOS.

<summary>How to install Linux</summary>

You'll need to pick a distribution to start with. If you are a beginner,
we recommend you to use an _Ubuntu_-based distribution: they have great
interfaces, are rather easy to user, and have a lot of documentation online.

Some of the best _Ubuntu_-based distributions:

- [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/): the most reliable
- [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/): the most modern
- [Zorin OS](https://zorinos.com/): the most user-friendly
- [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/): the most customizable

### MacOS

✅ Pros: very easy to use, and perfect for web development (it is also based on Unix,
as for Linux).

❌ Cons: it is expensive and you need to buy a Mac. Apple is also known
for spying its users.

### Windows

✅ Pros: you probably already know how to use it and are familiar with the
interface.

❌ Cons: you will have more bugs and problems during development, because
Windows is not meant for web development (it is not a Unix-based system).

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you are hesitating about installing Linux, you can use the best of Windows
and Linux with WSL: basically, it is a full Linux system which runs inside your
Windows.

✅ Pros: you keep the Windows interface that you're familiar with, but you can
also use all the Linux tools for web development.

❌ Cons: your computer will need more power and RAM to run both Windows
and Linux at the same time.

<summary>How to install WSL</summary>

First, you need to install **WSL2** on your Windows. Be sure to follow
[the official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install),
because it can be a bit tricky.

Then, you need to pick a distribution to start with: we recommend you to use
_Ubuntu_.

Finally, you need to install all programs and tools for your Linux system:
to do so, follow this documentation using the _Linux_ tab each time instead of
the _Windows_ tab, and run commands in the WSL terminal.

### Github Codespaces

Codespaces allows you to use a remote Linux machine, which runs on the Github
servers.

✅ Pros: you don't need to install anything (the remote machine is already
configured with all tools), and you can access it from anywhere through a
browser. It is also perfect if your computer does not have good performances.

❌ Cons: codespaces can be automatically deleted by Github after a certain
period of time if they are not used, so you need to be sure to commit and push
your changes frequently.

<details>
<summary>How to use Github Codespaces</summary>

1. Open the [Github repository](https://github.com/3cn-ecn/nantralPlatform)
   page.
2. Click the **Code** button, select **Codespaces**, and create a new
   codespace.
3. Wait for the codespace to be created. After it is done, you can directly
   go to the [First launch](../setup-project/setup-project.mdx) page.
