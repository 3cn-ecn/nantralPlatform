- Download **Node.js LTS** from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
  We recommend you to use the **LaTest Stable** version of **Node**
  (also called the "LTS" version). Currently, it is the 16.15.0 version.
- Install Node.js by clicking on the executable you just downloaded.

1. Install **fnm** to manage multiple node versions:
   - [follow the official instructions](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/blob/master/README.md#using-a-script-macoslinux)
1. Copy-paste the commands given at the end of the installation script into
   your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.
1. Activate the `--use-on-cd` config to automatically use the correct version
   on each project:
   - In the commands you pasted in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, replace
      ```bash
      eval "$(fnm env)"
      ```
      by
      ```bash
      eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"
      ```

Now, check that the installation was successful:

- Open a terminal and run `node -v`, and then `npm -v`.
- You should get a version number for each command. If you get an error such as `command not found`, the
  installation did not work. You can also have to restart your computer to make it work.

As you saw, node.js comes with two different commands:

- `node` is the programming language itself, which allow us to run scripts in javascript
- `npm` is the **n**ode **p**ackage **m**anager, which we will use to install dependencies
