# Linter and Formatter

Enforces a consistent coding style across the project, and catches bugs before
they come. To do so, we use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

## The Ruff Linter

The linter is a program which will raise errors if your code does not
respect the rules defined in the config.

To check all the backend code, run:

```bash
pipenv run lint
```

:::tip
The linter is run in real-time in VScode, if you have the
[Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
installed. It will show the errors directly in the editor, and propose a
fix for some of them.
:::

If you want to add an exception (for example when the linter raises an error
that is impossible to fix), you can ignore that error by adding a comment with
the error code:

```python title="mymodule.py"
my_variable = 1  # noqa: F001
```

You can also ignore an error for the entire file:

```python title="mymodule.py"
# ruff: noqa: F001
```

Ruff is a re-implementation of Flake8 in Rust, allowing faster linting and also
proposing auto-fixing. You can fix the fixable errors by running:

```bash
pipenv run lint:fix
```

Each error has a unique code, composed of a letter (which indicates which plugin
of Flake8 raised the error) and a number. You can
[find the list of all errors here](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/),
or by clicking on the error code in the VScode editor.

The configuration of the selected rules are stored in the `pyproject.toml` file.

## The Ruff Formatter

The Ruff formatter is based on `black`, a program which will automatically
format your code to respect the rules defined in the config. It will be executed
by running:

```bash
pipenv run lint:fix
```

Or by saving your file in VSCode, if you have the Ruff extension installed.
