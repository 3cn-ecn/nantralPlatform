# Architecture

Discover the architecture of the back-end!

<ArchitectureSvg />

## What's the back-end?

The back-end is the part of the application that runs on the **server**.
Its role is to:

- send data from the database to the front-end
- receive data from the front-end and store it in the database
- check if the user is authenticated
- check the permissions of the user to access content

In our case, the back-end is built with the [**Django**](https://docs.djangoproject.com) framework.

## How is it organized?

Each **feature** is stored in an **app**.
For example, we currently have these apps on Nantral Platform:
_account_, _groups_, _events_, _roommates_, _mentorship_...

Then, each app is organized as explained in the schema above.
We have:

- the _models_ in the `models.py` files
- the _views_ in the `views.py` or `api_views.py` files
- the _serializers_ in the `serializers.py` files
- the _urls_ in the `urls.py` or `api_urls.py` files

## The old (legacy) back-end

In some apps, you can also find two other types of files: **forms** and
**templates**. Their job is to replace the _serializers_, to return a full HTML
page instead of just some data.

These files replace the front-end.
They were used on _Nantral Platform_ **before** the React front-end was created,
but today, we try to _remove_ these files and only use React for the front-end.

## The helper files

There are 2 other types of files that are important, which are used to help
developers:

- **admin.py**: they are used to configure the admin interface of django,
  which you can access with an admin account
- **tests.py**: they are used to write tests for the app, which are very
  important to be sure we don't break anything when we modify the code
