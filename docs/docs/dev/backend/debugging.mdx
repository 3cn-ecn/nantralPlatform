Welcome to the hell of all programmers! Don't worry, we will help you to get out
of your bug.

:::tip The Debugging Guide
If you didn't read this guide before, well, you **MUST** begin with it. It will
save you a lot of time!

## Check-list

- Did you launch the backend with `pipenv run start` ?
- Is the server still running?
- Did you pull the latest changes with `git pull`?
- Are you on the right branch?
- Did you install the latest dependencies with `pipenv install` or `make update`?
- Did you apply the latest migrations with `pipenv run migrate` or `make update`?
- Does the admin interface (http://localhost:8000/admin) work?

## If you're still stuck

- **Reset the dependencies**:
  - remove the `.venv` folder and all of its content
  - run `pipenv install`
- **Reset the database**:
  - Rename your database file (for example `db.sqlite3` to `db.old.sqlite3`)
  - Run `pipenv run migrate` to create a new database
  - Run `pipenv run django createsuperuser` with _username=admin_ and
    _password=admin_
  - [Create your account on the new database](/dev/get-started/setup-project/#create-your-admin-account)
- **Ask Google/StackOverflow**: you will likely find an answer there.
  Be sure to make your search in English to get more results.
- **Ask an AI on [Poe.com](https://poe.com)**: if you give enough context, it can
  be very useful and save you a lot of time!
- **Ask a human**: if you are stuck, you can ask for help on the Discord server
  in the _`#je-galÃ¨re-avec-un-truc`_ channel.
  Be sure to give enough context to your issue, and explain what you have
  already tried.
  You can also ask a teacher.
