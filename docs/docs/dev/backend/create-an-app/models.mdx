# Models & Migrations

## Create and update models

To create a new model, you have to create a new class in the `models.py` file of
an app.

```python title="models.py"
from django.db import models

from apps.student.models import Student

class Event(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    begin_date = models.DateTimeField("DÃ©but")
    end_date = models.DateTimeField("Fin")
    publisher = models.ForeignKey(to=Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

:::danger Important note
After creating or updating a model, you must update the database!
:::

Now we need to update the database. First, let's create a migration file:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations [app_name]
```

Then, apply the migration on your own database:

```bash
pipenv run migrate
```

:::info Why migration files are important?

A migration files describe how to **move** the database from the previous
structure to the new **structure** you described in your models.
Without a migration file, **all data will be erased** each time you update
the models, which is not really what we want! ðŸ˜±

Most of the time, _Django_ is smart enough to migrate the data without loss.
But in some cases, the migration can be more **complicated** and you have to
**write** the migration file **_yourself_** to avoid any data loss!

See [More on migrations](#more-on-migrations) for more details.

Learn more on models and fields in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/).

## Query objects

In your view, you will often need to query objects from the database.
Here are some examples of how to do it:

```python
from .models import Event

def my_view(request):
    # Get one event
    my_event = Event.objects.get(id=2)
    # Get all events
    event_list = Event.objects.all()

    # Get events after a specific date
    recent_events = Event.objects.filter(begin_date__gte="2021-01-01")
    # or re-use the previous query
    recent_events = event_list.filter(begin_date__gte="2021-01-01")

    # Get events from a specific publisher
    current_student = request.user.student
    published_events = Event.objects.filter(publisher=current_student)
    # or use the reverse relation
    published_events = current_student.event_set.all()
```

Learn more on queries in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/).

## More on migrations

### Good practices

-  Try to **merge** migration files into **one file** as much as possible: we
   try to have as few migration files as possible. To do so, **_un-apply_** your
   last migrations files, **_delete_** them, and
   **_recreate a new_** migration file.
   :::warning Be careful
   You can't change migration files once they are uploaded to
   the `master` branch on the server.
   :::

### Applying and un-applying migrations

Let's suppose you have an app called `event`, with 5 files.
Only the first 2 migrations are applied on your database:

```python
0001_initial.py                  # already applied on your database
0002_auto_20200626_2132.py       # already applied on your database
0003_auto_social_network_init.py # not applied
0004_move_social_network.py      # not applied
0005_move_liste.py               # not applied
```

Now you can do multiple things:

-  If you want to apply **all migrations** (3, 4 and 5):
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event
   ```
-  If you want to apply **only** migrations 3 and 4, but not 5:
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event 0004
   ```
-  If you want to **un-apply** the migration nÂ°2,
   and return to the state after the migration nÂ°1:
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event 0001
   ```

### Writing a custom migration

You can write custom migrations, for example to transfer or copy data from
one table to another.

First, create an **_empty_** migration file with:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations <app_name> --empty --name <file_name>
```

Then, go to the `migrations` directory, and edit the new created file
to implement your custom migrations.

You can find examples of custom migrations by searching for `RunPython` in the
_Nantral Platform_ code. You can also use
[the django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/writing-migrations/)
to know how to write custom migrations.
