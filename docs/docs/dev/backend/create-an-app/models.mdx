# Models & Migrations

## Create and update models

To create a new model, you have to create a new class in the `models.py` file of
an app.

```python title="models.py"
from django.db import models

from apps.account.models import User

class Event(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    begin_date = models.DateTimeField("Début")
    end_date = models.DateTimeField("Fin")
    publisher = models.ForeignKey(to=User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

:::danger Important note
After creating or updating a model, you must update the database!
:::

Now we need to update the database. First, let's create a migration file:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations [app_name]
```

Then, apply the migration on your own database:

```bash
pipenv run migrate
```

:::info Why migration files are important?

A migration files describe how to **move** the database from the previous
structure to the new **structure** you described in your models.
Without a migration file, **all data will be erased** each time you update
the models, which is not really what we want! 😱

Most of the time, _Django_ is smart enough to migrate the data without loss.
But in some cases, the migration can be more **complicated** and you have to
**write** the migration file **_yourself_** to avoid any data loss!

See [More on migrations](#more-on-migrations) for more details.

Learn more on models and fields in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/).

### Group History

We use [django-simple-history](https://django-simple-history.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to keep a history of changes
on our group model. A few things needs to be considered:

- When adding a new field to the model, it will automatically be added to the tracked fields of the history model.
  If you don't want to track this field, you can set `excluded_fields` in the model's `history` attribute.
- When tracking a file field, the link with the original file is broken and only the path is stored in
  the database in the historical record. If you want to keep the file in the storage and are using our
  `CustomImageField`, you can set `delete_on_save` to `False` in the field parameters. This way, the image will not
  be deleted when updating the model.

## Query objects

In your view, you will often need to query objects from the database.
Here are some examples of how to do it:

```python
from .models import Event

def my_view(request):
    # Get one event
    my_event = Event.objects.get(id=2)
    # Get all events
    event_list = Event.objects.all()

    # Get events after a specific date
    recent_events = Event.objects.filter(begin_date__gte="2021-01-01")
    # or re-use the previous query
    recent_events = event_list.filter(begin_date__gte="2021-01-01")

    # Get events from a specific publisher
    published_events = Event.objects.filter(publisher=request.user)
    # or use the reverse relation
    published_events = request.user.event_set.all()
```

Learn more on queries in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/).

## More on migrations

### Good practices

- Try to **merge** migration files into **one file** as much as possible: we
  try to have as few migration files as possible. To do so, **_un-apply_** your
  last migrations files, **_delete_** them, and
  **_recreate a new_** migration file.
  :::warning Be careful
  You can't change migration files once they are uploaded to
  the `master` branch on the server.
  :::

### Applying and un-applying migrations

Let's suppose you have an app called `event`, with 5 files.
Only the first 2 migrations are applied on your database:

```python
0001_initial.py                  # already applied on your database
0002_auto_20200626_2132.py       # already applied on your database
0003_auto_social_network_init.py # not applied
0004_move_social_network.py      # not applied
0005_move_liste.py               # not applied
```

Now you can do multiple things:

- If you want to apply **all migrations** (3, 4 and 5):
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event
   ```
- If you want to apply **only** migrations 3 and 4, but not 5:
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event 0004
   ```
- If you want to **un-apply** the migration n°2,
  and return to the state after the migration n°1:
   ```bash
   pipenv run migrate event 0001
   ```

### Writing a custom migration

You can write custom migrations, for example to transfer or copy data from
one table to another.

First, create an **_empty_** migration file with:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations <app_name> --empty --name <file_name>
```

Then, go to the `migrations` directory, and edit the new created file
to implement your custom migrations.

You can find examples of custom migrations by searching for `RunPython` in the
_Nantral Platform_ code. You can also use
[the django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/writing-migrations/)
to know how to write custom migrations.
