# Database & Models

## Database schema

The following schema is an entity-relationship diagram of the database,
simplified for your convenience ðŸ˜‰

<DatabaseSchema />

In Django, entities are represented by a **model** class, and relationships are
directly represented by _OneToOneField_, _ForeignKey_ or _ManyToManyField_ fields.
Their translation to SQL is done by the Django ORM.

<summary>Want more? Here is the full schema, auto-generated</summary>

This schema has been generated by `django-extensions` with the `graphviz` program.
It shows all tables from the database, including the hidden ones created by
Django itself.

<summary>How to generate this schema</summary>

This model has been automatically generated with the method described on
[this post](https://medium.com/@yathomasi1/1-using-django-extensions-to-visualize-the-database-diagram-in-django-application-c5fa7e710e16).

If you have problems in running the method described above, you have to run before the other commands this command:
`sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev libpython3.7-dev`

## Create and update models

To create a new model, you have to create a new class in the `models.py` file of
an app.

```python title="models.py"
from django.db import models

from apps.another_app.models import AnotherModel

class MyModel(models.Model):
   name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
   description = models.TextField()
   created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
   another_model = models.ForeignKey(AnotherModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

:::danger Don't forget
After creating or updating a model, you must update the database!
:::

How? To update the database, first you have to create a migration file:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations [app_name]
```

Then, apply the migration on your own database:

```bash
pipenv run migrate
```

:::info Why migration files are important?

A migration files describe how to **move** the database from the previous
structure to the new **structure** you described in your models.
Without a migration file, **all data will be erased** each time you update
the models, which is not really what we want! ðŸ˜±

Most of the time, _Django_ is smart enough to migrate the data without loss.
But in some cases, the migration can be more **complicated** and you have to
**write** the migration file **_yourself_** to avoid any data loss!

See [More on migrations](#more-on-migrations) for more details.

Learn more on models and fields in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/models/).

## Query objects

In your view, you will often need to query objects from the database.
Here are some examples of how to do it:

```python
from .models import Group

# Get one object
bde_group = Group.objects.get(slug="bde")

# Get all objects
groups = Group.objects.all()

# Get a filtered list of objects
clubs_bde = Group.objects.filter(parent=bde_group)
# or re-use the previous query
clubs_bde = groups.filter(parent=bde_group)
# or use the related name (defined in the 'parent' field of the Group model)
clubs_bde = bde_group.children.all()
```

Learn more on queries in the [official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/).

## More on migrations

### Good practices

- Try to **merge** migration files into **one file** as much as possible: we
  try to have as few migration files as possible. To do so, **_un-apply_** your
  last migrations files, **_delete_** them, and
  **_recreate a new_** migration file.
  :::warning Be careful
  You can't change migration files once they are uploaded to
  the `master` branch on the server.
  :::

### Applying and un-applying migrations

Let's suppose you have an app called `group`, with 5 files.
Only the first 2 migrations are applied on your database:

```python
0001_initial.py                  # already applied on your database
0002_auto_20200626_2132.py       # already applied on your database
0003_auto_social_network_init.py # not applied
0004_move_social_network.py      # not applied
0005_move_liste.py               # not applied
```

Now you can do multiple things:

- If you want to apply **all migrations** (3, 4 and 5):
  ```bash
  pipenv run migrate group
  ```
- If you want to apply **only** migrations 3 and 4, but not 5:
  ```bash
  pipenv run migrate group 0004
  ```
- If you want to **un-apply** the migration nÂ°2,
  and return to the state after the migration nÂ°1:
  ```bash
  pipenv run migrate group 0001
  ```

### Writing a custom migration

You can write custom migrations, for example to transfer or copy data from
one table to another.

First, create an **_empty_** migration file with:

```bash
pipenv run makemigrations <app_name> --empty --name <file_name>
```

Then, go to the `migrations` directory, and edit the new created file
to implement your custom migrations.

You can find examples of custom migrations by searching for `RunPython` in the
_Nantral Platform_ code. You can also use
[the django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/writing-migrations/)
to know how to write custom migrations.
