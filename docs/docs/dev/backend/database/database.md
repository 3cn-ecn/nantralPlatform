# Database

The following schema is an entity-relationship diagram of the database,
simplified for your convenience ðŸ˜‰

<DatabaseSchema />

In Django, entities are represented by a **model** class, and relationships are
directly represented by _OneToOneField_, _ForeignKey_ or _ManyToManyField_ fields.
Their translation to SQL is done by the Django ORM.

This schema has been generated by `django-extensions` with the `graphviz` program.
It shows all tables from the database, including the hidden ones created by
