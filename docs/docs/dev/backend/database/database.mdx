# Database

## Schema

The following schema is an entity-relationship diagram of the database,
simplified for your convenience ðŸ˜‰

<DatabaseSchema />

In Django, entities are represented by a **model** class, and relationships are
directly represented by _OneToOneField_, _ForeignKey_ or _ManyToManyField_ fields.
Their translation to SQL is done by the Django ORM.

This schema has been generated by `django-extensions` with the `graphviz` program.
It shows all tables from the database, including the hidden ones created by
Django itself.

<summary>How to generate this schema</summary>

This model has been automatically generated with the method described on
[this post](https://medium.com/@yathomasi1/1-using-django-extensions-to-visualize-the-database-diagram-in-django-application-c5fa7e710e16).

If you have problems in running the method described above, you have to run before the other commands this command:
`sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev libpython3.7-dev`

## Use fake data

You can generate fake random data for the database using this command:

```bash
pipenv run fakedata
```

You can also generate data for a specific app, for example `event`:

```bash
pipenv run fakedata event
```

The fake data generators are defined in the `factories.py` files of each app,
using [`factory-boy`](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
[`Faker`](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/#contents).
