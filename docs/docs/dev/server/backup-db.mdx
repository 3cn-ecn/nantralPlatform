# Backups

This page is about backups of the database on the server. It requires you to have access to the server and already been connected to the ssh terminal.

:::info Note
To create backups manually and restore a backup, you'll need to have access to
the server. To do so, [create a SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
if you don't have one yet, and send the public key to an admin to add it on the server.

Then, you can connect to the server with:

```bash
ssh <username>@nantral-platform.fr
```

_Ask an admin for the `<username>` of the server's user session._

## ðŸ”„ Automatic Backups

-  Backups are made every day at 05:00 AM and each time you push an update to the server.
-  Backups are stored on our S3 bucket on OVH.
-  When a new backup is created, a cleanup is run to keep only the last 20 backups.

You can find and download the backups on the OVH platform, in
_Public Cloud > Object Storage > Backups_.

<summary>Create backups manually</summary>

1. Log into the server:
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@nantral-platform.fr
   ```
1. CD into the development directory:
   ```bash
   cd nantralPlatform/deployment
   ```
1. Create a backup of the database:
   ```bash
   docker exec deployment_database_1 pg_dump -U <db_username> <db_name> > backup.sql
   ```
   > _You can find `<db_username>` and `<db_name>` in the `backend.env` file. A file named `backup.sql` will then be created in the `deployment` directory._
1. Exit from the server:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
1. Copy the backup file from the server to your local computer:
   ```bash
   scp <username>@nantral-platform.fr:~/nantralPlatform/deployment/dump.sql ./dump.sql
   ```

## ðŸ’¾ Restore a backup

1. Copy the backup file from your local computer to the server:
   ```bash
   scp backup.sql.gz <username>@nantral-platform.fr:~/nantralPlatform/deployment/backup.sql.gz
   ```
1. Log into the server:
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@nantral-platform.fr
   ```
1. CD into the deployment directory:
   ```bash
   cd nantralPlatform/deployment
   ```
1. Unzip the backup file:
   ```bash
   gunzip backup.sql.gz
   ```
1. Copy the backup from the server to the Postgres docker container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker cp backup.sql deployment_database_1:dump.sql
   ```
1. Open the container's shell:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it deployment_database_1 bin/sh
   ```
1. Replace the current database with the backup:
   ```bash
   psql -U <db_username> <db_name> < dump.sql
   ```
   > _You can find `<db_username>` and `<db_name>` in the `backend.env` file._
1. Delete the backup.sql file in the container:
   ```bash
   rm backup.sql
   ```
1. Exit the container:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
1. Delete the backup.sql file in the server:
   ```bash
   rm backup.sql
   ```
1. Exit the server:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
