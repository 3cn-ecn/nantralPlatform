# Email server

To be able to send and receive emails with the `@nantral-platform.fr` domain,
we need an email server. This server runs on the same server as the Nantral
Platform website.

## Accessing the emails

We do not host a webmail. You have to use a local mail client such as [Thunderbird](http://thunderbird.net/) to access the emails.

To configure an account, simply add a new account in Thunderbird with the email and password, and the rest of the configuration should be autodiscovered.

Currently, the only existing email account is `admin@nantral-platform.fr`, and it has the following aliases:

-  contact@nantral-platform.fr
-  group-manager@nantral-platform.fr
-  no-reply@nantral-platform.fr
-  postmaster@nantral-platform.fr

## Accessing the mailserver's administration page

The mailserver's administration page is available at [`https://mail.nantral-platform.fr/`](https://mail.nantral-platform.fr/).

Please contact the current president of the club to get access to the administration page.

Detailed documentation on this interface is available [on the Stalwart website](https://stalw.art/docs/management/webadmin/overview).

## Architecture details

We use [Stalwart](https://stalw.art/) with Docker to handle our emails. We used to use Mailu, but Stalwart is a much more lightweight alternatives, written in Rust.

Stalwart uses the same certificates as the one used by Traefik, our reverse proxy. They are dumped periodically with `traefik-cert-dumper`.

The emails and accounts are stored in the `stalwart` table on the PostgreSQL database.
