# Architecture

Discover the architecture of the front-end!

<ArchitectureSvg />

## What's the front-end?

The front-end is the part of the application that runs on the **client**.
Its role is to:

- display the data to the user
- send data to the back-end
- manage the user's interactions

In our case, the front-end is built with the [**React**](https://reactjs.org) library.

## React is NOT a framework

React is a **library**, which is only useful for building user interfaces.
Since it isn't a framework, we need other libraries to build a complete front-end:

- [**React Router**](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) for routing
  (i.e. managing the URLs and the pages)
- [**React Query**](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/quick-start)
  for data fetching and caching (i.e. using the API)
- [**React Hook Form**](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started#IntegratingwithUIlibraries)
  for forms
- [**MUI**](https://mui.com) for the design system

## The old (legacy) front-end

The old front-end was built with the [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com)
template system, which is a server-side rendering system.
But, in some cases, we injected some React components in the Django templates
to make the front-end more dynamic.

These injected React component are stored in the `frontend/legacy` folder:
they are standalone components which are not part of a page.
