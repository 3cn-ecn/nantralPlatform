## Common issues on the frontend

Here is a list of common problems you should check if you encounter a problem.

### Check-list

- Did you launch the frontend with `npm run start` ?
- Did you install the latest dependencies with `npm install`?
- Is the server running?

### If you're still stuck

- Reset the _vite_ builder:
   - remove the `.vite` folder (sometimes in `node_modules`) and all of its content
   - run `npm run start` to make a clean build
- Reset the dependencies:
   - remove the `node_modules` folder and all of its content
   - run `npm ci` to make a clean Install

## Other issues

Local issues can be hard to track down. Don't hesitate to:

- **Ask Google/StackOverflow**: you will likely find an answer there.
  Be sure to make your search in English to get more results.
- **Ask an IA like _ChatGPT_**: if you give enough context, it can
  be very useful and save you a lot of time!
- **Ask a human**: if you are stuck, you can ask for help on the Discord server
  in the _`#je-galère-avec-un-truc`_ channel.
  Be sure to give enough context to your issue, and explain what you have
  already tried.
  You can also ask a teacher.
