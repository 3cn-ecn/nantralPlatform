## Common issues on the frontend

Here is a list of common problems you should check if you encounter a problem.

### Check-list

-  Did you launch the frontend with `npm run start` ?
-  Did you install the latest dependencies with `npm install`?
-  Is the server running?

### If you're still stuck

-  Reset the _vite_ builder:
   -  remove the `.vite` folder (sometimes in `node_modules`) and all of its content
   -  run `npm run start` to make a clean build
-  Reset the dependencies:
   -  remove the `node_modules` folder and all of its content
   -  run `npm ci` to make a clean Install

## Other issues

Local issues can be hard to track down. Don't hesitate to:

-  **Ask Google/StackOverflow**: you will likely find an answer there.
   Be sure to make your search in English to get more results.
-  **Ask an IA like _ChatGPT_**: if you give enough context, it can
   be very useful and save you a lot of time!
-  **Ask a human**: if you are stuck, you can ask for help on the Discord server
   in the _`#je-galÃ¨re-avec-un-truc`_ channel.
   Be sure to give enough context to your issue, and explain what you have
   already tried.
   You can also ask a teacher.
