## Common issues on the backend

Here is a list of common problems you should check if you encounter a problem.

### Check-list

### If you're still stuck

- Reset the dependencies:

  - Run `pipenv run migrate` to create a new database

  Be sure to make your search in English to get more results.
- **Ask an IA like _ChatGPT_**: if you give enough context, it can
  be very useful and save you a lot of time!
- **Ask a human**: if you are stuck, you can ask for help on the Discord server
  in the _`#je-galÃ¨re-avec-un-truc`_ channel.
  Be sure to give enough context to your issue, and explain what you have
  already tried.
  You can also ask a teacher.
