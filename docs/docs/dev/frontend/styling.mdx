# Styling

## Rule 1: don't use styles

In Nantral Platform, we use the [**MUI**](https://mui.com/) library to style our
components. This means that all styling things are managed by the library,
and we only configure it through the **`theme.ts`** file.

:::tip How to style, then?

If you need to style something, first use this **check-list** to ensure you are
not doing something wrong:

1. Check if the component you need does not already exist:
   -  in the [**MUI Components library**](https://mui.com/material-ui/all-components/);
   -  or in the `frontend/src/shared/components` folder.
2. If you want to **modify the styles** of one component:
   -  you are **_breaking_** the design system => try to use the current
      **theme**, or update the theme (you can modify it or extend it);
3. If the component does not exist, then **create it** in the shared folder (but use
   theme variables to style it)!

## The exception rule: use `sx` props for `padding` only

Well, this rule is pretty clear üòÅ But why is that, you might ask?

-  for `margins`, it is better to replace them with `<Spacer>` components, or
   by using `gap` in `<FlexRow>` or `<FlexColumn>` components;
-  `width` and `height` should be fixed by the grid your component is in, not on
   the component itself;
-  other styling properties (like `color`, `background`, `border`, etc.) should
   be managed by the theme.

## Can I use HTML tags (`div`, `h1`...)?

‚ùå No.

Ideally, you should always use the `MUI` equivalents of HTML tags:

-  `div` => `Box`, `Container`, `FlexRow`, ...
-  `a` => `Link`, with `component={ReactRouterLink}`
   (cf [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link))
   if the link is internal
-  `p` => `Typography`
-  `h1` => `Typography` with `variant="h1"`

The reason of that is to ensure that the components are **styled correctly**,
and **respect** the MUI theme.

The only exception to this principle is `<img>`, because there is no equivalent
in MUI (and also no need).

## Ok I understand, but I need custom styles

Ok, if you need custom styles, you can use these options:

-  preferably, use the `sx` props with theme variables from the `useTheme` hook
   to add CSS properties:

   ```tsx
   import { useTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

   const theme = useTheme();
   const sx: SxProps = {
      color: theme.palette.primary.main,
      padding: theme.spacing(2),
   };
   ```

-  if the component does not have a `sx` prop (it exists only on MUI components),
   you can use the `style` prop;
-  if your CSS is too complex, you can create a new **SCSS file** and add your
   styles there. However, it has some limitations:
   -  you **can't use theme** variables from MUI;
   -  on the build phase, all `CSS` and `SCSS` files will be **merged** together,
      so you should be **_very_** careful with the class names you use.
