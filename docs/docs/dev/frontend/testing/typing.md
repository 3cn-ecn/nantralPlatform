# Typing

How to check that the types of our code is correct?

Testing the types of our code is important, because it allows us to detect
errors before they happen. It also allows us to have a better understanding of
the code we are writing!

To do so, we use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)! Typescript
errors should appear directly in your IDE, but you can manually check for all
files by running:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run types
```
