# Mini-projects

This page proposes some mini-projects to help you engage with the world of
web development!

For each project, don't hesitate to use tutorials on the internet
(they are many of them!), but also try to make things by yourself,
you will learn better.

‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: This indicates an estimation of the time for doing the project,
with approximately 5 hours per week.

**‚úÖ What you have to do:** the objectives of the project.

:::tip
See the **[Resources](/dev/resources.mdx)** page for some useful links!
:::

## Project 1: Discover HTML and CSS

‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: ‚âà 3 weeks, maximum 2 months (switch to the next project after)

**‚úÖ What you have to do:**

- Create a website with your CV (_Curriculum Vitae_)
- Use only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript
- Your site should have some images, multiple pages, and be beautiful!

## Project 2: Become a front end developer

‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: ‚âà 5 weeks, maximum 3 months (switch to the next project after)

**‚úÖ What you have to do:**

- Create a single-page app that runs without internet. It can be a calculator, a video
  player, a to-do app...
- Make your app with **React**, in **TypeScript**.
- Again, use tutorials to help you at the beginning, but as a hint we recommend
  you to start with `create-react-app`.

## Project 3: Become a back end developer

‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: ‚âà 3 weeks, maximum 2 months (switch to the next project after)

**‚úÖ What you have to do:**

- Create a website with **Django**. It can be anything you want (you can follow
  a tutorial if you do not have any idea).
- Your website should focus on having a database, and what you do with it: do
  not focus on the design.

## Project 4: Become a full-stack developer!

‚è±Ô∏è **Time**: ‚âà 2 weeks, maximum 2 months (switch to the next project after)

**‚úÖ What you have to do:**

- Create a full web-application with a React front end and a Django back end.
- Your front end should display information that are stored in your database,
  in the back end.
- Make queries between the two, with `django-rest-framework`, `axios`, and
  `react-query`.
- You can re-use your previous projects.

## Congratulations ü•≥

You are now ready to contribute to any web project, and especially
