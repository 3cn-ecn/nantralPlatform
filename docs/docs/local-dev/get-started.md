# Get started

_Things to do the first time you want to develop!_

## 1. Cloning the repository

### 1. Cloning the repository {.tabset}

#### Using Github Desktop

1. Start Github Desktop
2. Select "Clone a repository from the internet" (if you don't see the button, select File > Clone repository)
3. Paste the repository url: `https://github.com/nantral-platform/nantralPlatform.git`, or only `nantral-platform/nantralPlatform` and clone the repository!
4. Wait during the download, and then click the "Open in Visual Studio Code" button

#### Using VSCode

1. Start by opening VSCode.
2. Once your folder is opened, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (for Mac users: <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>), then type `Clone` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
3. In the prompt window, paste `https://github.com/nantral-platform/nantralPlatform.git`.
4. When prompted, select a folder where you want to clone the repository. This will create a folder named `nantralPlatform` where everything will be stored.
5. Open the `nantralPlatform` folder in VSCode once the repository has ben cloned.

## 2. Discover the project structure

### Description

In VSCode, in the left panel, you can see the folder structure of the repository. Here are a few explanations about the purpose of the main folders.

```js
📁.github  //Contains the definitions for github actions
📁frontend //Contains source files to be compiled for the frontend
📁backend  //Contains source files for the backend
    📁static //Contains static files to be served by the server
```

### Frontend

The frontend is an NPM application which uses React.js.
Source files are compiled using Babel and Webpack and the output is stored in `server/static/js`.

### Backend

The backend is a django application. The main files are organised like this:

```js
📁apps //Contains all the applications
📁config //General config folder
    📁settings
        📄base.py //Base settings
        📄dev-local.py //Settings for local dev
        📄production.py //Settings for production
    📄asgi.py
    📄urls.py //General url config
    📄wsgi.py
📁templates //Genral template folder
📄manage.py //General script to launch and make migrations
📄requirements.txt //Contains python requirements
```

## 3. Set up your Python's virtual environment

> Depending on how you installed Python, you might not invoke it the same way as in this tutorial. We will use `python3`, but you might need to change it to `py`, `py3` or even `python`. To check which one works for you, run `py --v`, `python3 --v`, `py3 --v` or `python --v` in your terminal and see which one works for you. The same applies to the `pip` or `pip3` command.
> {.is-warning}

> In this tutorial, you will often use the <kbd>cd</kbd> command in your terminal. To move to a directory, you simply have to indicate the folder name, for example <kbd>cd&nbsp;server</kbd>. If you want to go back to the parent directory, you can use <kbd>cd&nbsp;..</kbd>. The name <kbd>.</kbd> represents the current directory and <kbd>..</kbd> the parent one.

### Server {.tabset}

#### Windows

1. In VSCode, click on the _Terminal_ tab, then on _New Terminal_.
2. In the terminal, type `cd backend` to change your directory to the `backend` directory.
3. Install virtualenv by running `python3 -m pip install virtualenv`.
4. Create a virtualenv with `python3 -m virtualenv env`.
5. Activate your venv with `env\Scripts\activate.bat` with CMD or `env\Scripts\activate.ps1` with PowerShell. _(With Powershell, if you have an error run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser`.)_ If the activation succeds, you would notice the `(env)` at the first left of the command prompt.
6. Install the dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to setup your database.
8. If you don't see any errors, you can move on to the next step.

#### MacOS/Linux

1. In VSCode, click on the _Terminal_ tab, then on _New Terminal_.
2. In the terminal, type `cd backend` to change your directory to the `backend` directory.
3. Run `./install.sh` to run the installation process.
4. If the activation succeeds, you will notice a `(env)` at the far left of the command prompt.
5. If you don't see any errors, you can move on to the next step.

## 4. Create the .env file

> On the server, we need some passwords in our code. But for security issues, these passwords can't be synchronized on Github. That's why you have to add these settings yourself, with your own passwords. Don't panic if you don't have ones: you can let them blank if you do not want to developp the corresponding function.
> {.is-info}

1. In VSCode, create a file named `.env` inside the folder `backend/config/settings`.
2. Inside it, copy and paste the contents of the `env.example` file located in `backend/config/settings`.

## 5. Compiling the React code

1. Inside VSCode, open another terminal using the _Terminal_ tab.
2. In this terminal, type `cd frontend` to change your directory to the `frontend` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. This might take a minute.
4. Then run `npm run dev` to compile the code into the `backend/static/js` folder.
5. If you don't see any errors, you can close the terminal.

## 6. Running the backend

1. Go back to the VScode terminal in the `backend` folder.
2. Your virtualenv should have automatically been activated (notice the `(env)` at the far left of the command prompt). If you don't see it, activate your virtualenv using the instructions in the dedicated section at the end of this page.
3. Create an administrator account with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`.
4. Run `python3 manage.py runserver`.
5. Congratulations ! You can now access the website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) 🥳
6. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the terminal to stop the backend.

# Commands you will use everyday

_Now that Nantral Platform development environment is installed, we'll take a closer look to the commands you will have to use each time you developp something on the application._

## 1. Launch the server

Suppose that during your coffee break, Windows made an update an restarted your computer. How to run the server again whitout reinstalling erveything like above ?

1. If you use Github Desktop, open it, then open the repository in VScode. Else, directly open the directory in VScode.
2. Open a new terminal in VScode if there is no one (_Terminal_ tab > _New terminal_)
3. Go into the `backend` folder with `cd` command
4. Activate your virtualenv (see the dedicated section below, at the end)
5. Visit your local website at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), or shutdown the server with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

## 2. Pull last updates

When someone else make some updates, you make a `pull` with git to update your local copy of nantral platform (e.g. with Github Desktop, or git in VScode, or git in command line). When you pull last updates, you will probably have to:

- **update your python dependencies:** in the `backend` folder, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- **update your database:** in the `backend` folder, run `python3 manage.py migrate`
- **update your React dependencies:** in the `frontend` folder, run `npm install`
- **update your compiled React files:** in the `frontend` folder, run `npm run dev`

## 3. Migrations

- Whenever you make a change to your database's structure (basically each time you modify one of the `models.py` file), you need to save the modifications of your database in a file so as to other users can know the database modifications. In the `backend` folder, run `python3 manage.py makemigrations` to automatically create these files
- Then, you can apply these modifications to your own database by running `python3 manage.py migrate`

Some good practices:

- The migration files are saved in the `migrations` folder in each app. Try to rename the migrations scripts to something more understandable for a human. Example : rename `migration01.py` to `create_news_model_alter_clubs.py`
- Try also to merge migrations into one migration as much as possible.
- Be careful: you can't change your migration files once you migrate your database. If you want to merge them before pushing your updates to the server for example, you'll have to destroy your database (simply delete the `db.sqlite3` file).

## 4. Creating a new server app

In django, all functionnalities are separeted in "apps". Each "app" correspond to a directory in the `server/apps` folder.

- To create a new app in the django server, use `python manage.py startapp app_name`. This will create a new folder with the app name you chose.
- Then move the app folder to the main `apps` folder, so as to have all apps in the same place.
- **In your new app folder:**
  - Create or update a `urls.py` script inside the folder. Base this script on other `urls.py` you can find in other apps
  - Update the `apps.py` script, by replacing `name = 'app_name'` by `name = 'apps.app_name'`
- **Then in the `server/config` folder:**
  _ In the `urls.py` script, add a namespace for your app like this: `url('app_name/', include('apps.app_name.urls', namespace='app_name')),`. This will link the url router to your urls.py script in the app you created.
  _ Finally add the app in `settings/base.py`:
  `COMMON_APPS = [ 'apps.app_name', ]`
  Some defaults tables have been added in your database: run the migrations (see section 3), and then run the server!

## 5. Developp the frontend

For the frontend part, all informations are explained on the dedicated page: [Frontend with React](./react).

## 6. Manage your virtualenv

A virtualenv allow you to have certain requirements versions for a project which are differents from the ones you have on your computer.

### a) Create a virtualenv

First you have to enable the functionnality by installing the package `virtualenv` whith pip: `python3 -m pip install virtualenv`. Then you can create a virtualenv in a folder by running `python3 -m virtualenv env`, where `env` is your virtualenv name. For this project, we create the virtualenv in the `server` directory.

### b) Activate a virtualenv

You need to activate your virtualenv before doing anything using Python about the project. Once the virtualenv is activated, you will notice the `(env)` at the far left of the command prompt.

#### Activate a virtualenv {.tabset}

##### MacOS/Linux

- Go to the folder which contains your virtualenv: `cd backend`
- Run `source env/bin/activate`

##### Windows (with CMD)

- Go to the folder which contains your virtualenv: `cd backend`
- Run `env\Scripts\activate.bat`

##### Windows (with Powershell)

- Go to the folder which contains your virtualenv: `cd backend`
- Run `env\Scripts\activate.ps1`

### c) Deactivate a virtualenv

Close your virtualenv with `deactivate` anywhere.

### d) Alternative: virtualenvwrapper

Alternatively, you can use `virtualenvwrapper` to easily manage several virtualenv. Follow the [instructions here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment#using_django_inside_a_python_virtual_environment) to install it. Once installed, you can use:

- `mkvirtualenv env_name` to create a virtual env
- `workon env_name` to activate a virtual env (it doesn't depends on the current folder you're in)
- `deactivate` to close the virtual env

Since the installation is a little more tricky, we do not recommand this for beginners; however, if you succeed to install it before (for example doing the MDN tutorial), you can use it if you prefere.
