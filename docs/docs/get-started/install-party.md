# Install Party

Let's start by installing all the programs we need!

To do this, we will need to use the terminal: make sure that you know how to open it and use it.

<details>
<summary>Help! I don't know what a terminal is ðŸ˜¢</summary>
Don't worry, we will explain you the basics ðŸ˜‰
<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

On Windows, you have two terminals: `CMD`, the oldest one, and `Powershell`, the new one. We recommend you to
use Powershell.

To open a terminal, simply type `Powershell` or `CMD` in the search bar of your system, and open it like any 
application. There you are! A new window with some white lines should appear.

The directory where you are is shown on the last line. By default, it should be your user directory, so 
something like `C:\Users\michel\`. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd ".\my_subdirectory\"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory` (try with the default directory 
    `Downloads` !). The `.` in this command represents the current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals
    (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

Open Spotlight, and type `terminal`. Then you can launch the `terminal.app` application, and voilÃ !
By default, you are in your home directory. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd "./my_subdirectory/"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory`. The `.` in this command represents the 
    current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

The name of your terminal depends on your distribution. For example, it is "Terminal" for Ubuntu, or "Konsole" 
for Kubuntu.
By default, you are in your home directory. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd "./my_subdirectory/"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory`. The `.` in this command represents the 
    current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

## Python

Python is the program corresponding to the famous language. We recommend to use Python `3.10` since it is the latest 
stable version, but you can use other versions (minimum `3.7`).

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

Download and install Python from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).

:::info
You can also download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In this case, be careful
to check the **"Add python to the PATH"** option during the installation.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure
to check the **"Add python to the PATH"** option during the installation!

:::caution
MacOS has already python installed, but the Python 2 version. Unfortunately, it is not compatible with Python 3,
so you have to install both versions side by side. If it does not work the first time, you can find tutorials on
Internet to solve it.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Open a terminal and run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y`.

:::caution
Some Linux distributions come with `Python` already installed. In this case, try to check your python version: 
if your version is bellowed `3.7`, you might need to upgrade your distribution.
::: 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the installation, check that it works properly:
* Open a new terminal
* Type the command `python --version` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to run it.
* You should see the Python version on a new line: `Python 3.10`
* If you get an error, or if the version is incorrect, try to replace `python` by `python3`, `py`, or `py3`. Remember
    it: you will need to replace it every time in the following.

## Node.js

We recommend you to use the latest stable version of Node (also called the "LTS" version). Currently, it is the
16.15.0 version.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

- Download **Node.js LTS** from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install Node.js by clicking on the executable you just downloaded.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

- Open a terminal and run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm -y`.

:::info
You might need in the future to have different versions of node.js installed for different projects. To manage them,
you can check the `nvm` package which allowed you to have multiple versions of node.js.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Check that the installtion was successful: 
- Open a terminal and run `node -v`, then `npm -v`. 
- You should get a version number for each command. If you get an error such as `command not found`, the 
    installation did not work. You can also have to restart your computer to make it work.

As you saw, node.js comes with two different commands:
* `node` is the programming language itself, which allow us to run scripts in javascript
* `npm` is the **n**ode **p**ackage **m**anager, which we will use to install dependencies
