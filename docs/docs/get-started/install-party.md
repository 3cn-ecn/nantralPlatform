# Install Party

Let's start by installing all the programs we need!

To do this, we will need to use the terminal: make sure that you know how to open it and use it.

<details>
<summary>Help! I don't know what a terminal is ðŸ˜¢</summary>
Don't worry, we will explain you the basics ðŸ˜‰
<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

On Windows, you have two terminals: `CMD`, the oldest one, and `Powershell`, the new one. We recommend you to
use Powershell.

To open a terminal, simply type `Powershell` or `CMD` in the search bar of your system, and open it like any 
application. There you are! A new window with some white lines should appear.

The directory where you are is shown on the last line. By default, it should be your user directory, so 
something like `C:\Users\michel\`. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd ".\my_subdirectory\"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory` (try with the default directory 
    `Downloads` !). The `.` in this command represents the current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals
    (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

Open Spotlight, and type `terminal`. Then you can launch the `terminal.app` application, and voilÃ !
By default, you are in your home directory. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd "./my_subdirectory/"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory`. The `.` in this command represents the 
    current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

The name of your terminal depends on your distribution. For example, it is "Terminal" for Ubuntu, or "Konsole" 
for Kubuntu.
By default, you are in your home directory. You can deplace to other directories with:
* `cd "./my_subdirectory/"`: go into the subdirectory `my_subdirectory`. The `.` in this command represents the 
    current directory. Note that the `"` are optionals (they are required only if your path contains spaces).
* `cd ..`: go to the parent directory
* `ls`: list all the files and sub-directories of the current directory

## Python

Python is the program corresponding to the famous language. We recommend to use Python `3.10` since it is the latest 
stable version, but you can use other versions (minimum `3.7`).

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

Download and install Python from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).

:::info
You can also download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). In this case, be careful
to check the **"Add python to the PATH"** option during the installation.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure
to check the **"Add python to the PATH"** option during the installation!

:::caution
MacOS has already python installed, but the Python 2 version. Unfortunately, it is not compatible with Python 3,
so you have to install both versions side by side. If it does not work the first time, you can find tutorials on
Internet to solve it.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Open a terminal and run
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

:::caution
Some Linux distributions come with `Python` already installed. In this case, try to check your python version: 
if your version is belowed `3.7`, you might need to upgrade your distribution.
::: 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the installation, check that it works properly:
* Open a new terminal
* Type the command `python --version` and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to run it.
* You should see the Python version on a new line: `Python 3.10`

<details>
    <summary>The command does not work or the version is incorrect, what can I do?</summary>

Sometimes you can have multiple versions of python installed on your system: in this case, using `python` can refer to
another version of python (for instance, it refers by default to python2 if it is installed). 

To avoid this, you can precise which version you want to use by adding the version to the command: try to run 
`python3Â --version` or `python3.10Â --version` for example, to get the correct version.

Also notice that on Windows, `python` is sometimes replaced by `py` only: in this case, you can precise the version
by runnning `pyÂ -3` for example.

**Once you have found the command that works for you, memorize it: in the following, we will always use `python` or 
`python3` but you might need to replace it by the versionned command that works for you.**

</details>

### Pip

Pip should have been installed with Python. To verify this, run `pip --version`. It should produce a line like this:
```bash
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)
```

Check that the python version indicated at the end of the line is correct. If not, you can try to run `pip3` instead
to force pip to use python3.

<details>
<summary>I have the error <em>"command pip not found"</em>, what can I do?</summary>

First, pip is maybe not installed on your system. To install it, run
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

Then, you should get pip through this command:
```bash
python -m pip --version
```

:::note
Don't forget to replace `python` by `python3` or `py` if needed, as we have seen previsouly.
:::

Finally, try to launch the pip command directly: 
```bash
pip --version
```

If this last command does not work, that means that pip is not installed in your PATH. You can easily find
how to install it by a search, or you can replace `pip` by `python -m pip` if it does not bother you.
</details>

### Virtualenv

Finally we will install the virtualenv module. This module allows us to to install all dependencies for a project in
a python virtual environment so as to not have conflicts between the dependencies of multiple projects.

Install it by running:
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

:::note
If you used `pip3` or `python -m pip` instead of `pip` in the previous section, make sure to replace it again for this
command. In the following, we will only use `pip` for simplicity, but you still have to replace it each time we use it.
:::

That's it! You finished to install python, congratulations ðŸ¥³

## Node.js

We recommend you to use the latest stable version of Node (also called the "LTS" version). Currently, it is the
16.15.0 version.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win-mac" label="Windows/MacOS">

- Download **Node.js LTS** from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install Node.js by clicking on the executable you just downloaded.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="lin" label="Linux">

Open a terminal and run
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
```

:::info
You might need in the future to have different versions of node.js installed for different projects. To manage them,
you can check the `nvm` package which allowed you to have multiple versions of node.js.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Check that the installtion was successful: 
- Open a terminal and run `node -v`, and then `npm -v`. 
- You should get a version number for each command. If you get an error such as `command not found`, the 
    installation did not work. You can also have to restart your computer to make it work.

As you saw, node.js comes with two different commands:
* `node` is the programming language itself, which allow us to run scripts in javascript
* `npm` is the **n**ode **p**ackage **m**anager, which we will use to install dependencies

## Congratulations ðŸ¥³

You installed all the programs! Now let's try some exercices and tutorials so as to learn the different concepts
of the Nantral Platform project.
