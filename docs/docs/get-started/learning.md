# Learning

Before doing your first steps on Nantral Platform, you might need to learn how to use the different frameworks we use
on the Nantral Platform project. Let's follow the steps!

## The basics of the web: backend and frontend

### Definitions

First, you need to understand the difference between frontend and backend:
* **the frontend**: it is the code which is compiled and run on the **client**, that is to say in the own browser
    of the user. Its purpose is to simulate the behavior of a regular application.
* **the backend**: it is the code which will run on the **server**. Its purpose is to make the link between the frontend
    and the database: when a user register himself in a group for example, the frontend will send a request to the
    backend, and then the backend will verify the rights of the user and update the database in consequence.

### Languages and frameworks

For the nantral platform project, we use two main languages and frameworks for the backend and the frontend:
* **on the backend**: we use [Python](https://www.python.org/), with the framework [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* **on the frontend**: we use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with the framework [React](https://reactjs.org/)

:::success What is a framework?
A framework is a module, or a library, with a set of predefined useful functions to achieve a certain goal.
For instance, django gives functions to connect to the database or to manage the http protocol, so as we don't have
to implement these functions ourselves.

## Learn django

Firts, let's begin with django! 
Follow this tutorial to learn how to use django and what it can do for you: [Django Web Framework (Python) - 
Learn Web Development | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django).

In this tutorial, you can skip some steps:
* [Setting up a Django development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment):
    you can skip the *Install Python 3* section, and the *Using Django inside a Python virtual environment*. Instead,
    create a virtual environment with the easier method described below.
* You can also skip the *Sessions framework*, *Working with forms*, and *Deploying Django to production* pages.

:::note Using Python virtualenv

This note explains how to create and use a virtual environment for python. You can use also the method described in
the previous tutorial, but it is more difficult to install when you start coding.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

First, open a terminal and go into the directory when you want to create a virtual environment:
```bash
cd .\Documents\dev\my_project
```

Then create your virtual environment, named `venv` for example:
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

Notice that a new directory named `venv` has been created in your folder: it will contain all the python packages
we will install in this virtual environment.

Then, activate the virtualenv:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ps1" label="With Powershell">

```bash
venv\bin\activate.ps1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cmd" label="With CMD">

```bash
venv\bin\activate.bat
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-lin" label="MacOS/Linux">

First, open a terminal and go into the directory when you want to create a virtual environment:
```bash
cd ./dev/my_project
```

Then create your virtual environment, named `venv` for example:
```bash
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

Notice that a new directory named `venv` has been created in your folder: it will contain all the python packages
we will install in this virtual environment.

Then, activate the virtualenv:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you should see an indicator `(venv)` at the beginning of the command line: that confirms that it works, 
congratulations! ðŸ¥³

When you have finished to work on your virtual environment, you can deactivate your virtual environment by simply running:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Learn React

Did you get the basis of django? Now, it's time to learn **React**!

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</details>

React is a framework for the javascript language. In our case, we will use it with the typescript language,
which is a variant of javascript (see the videos below).

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</details>

Now, you can follow the [official tutorial of React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to get the basis of 
the framework!

> Note: for the *Setup* section, choose the option 2: *Local development environment*.


## The REST API: make React and django work together

Now that you know how to make the backend and the frontend, it's time to put them together, using REST API.

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
        allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</details>

To learn this concept, you will create your own application with React, django, and REST API:
[follow this tutorial!](https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-an-app-with-react-and-django/)

## The youtube player mini-project

Now to conclude, let's time to create your own mini-project with all the elements we have seen!

Your goal is to create a youtube player, with a support for history. You will have to use django as the backend and 
use react as the frontend. Your project should do the following:
* The interface should have an input field where the user can paste the url of a youtube video
* You should be able to show and play the requested video in your interface
* When you open a new video, this video is saved into the history, in the database of django
* You should have a place in your interface to see all the videos of the history (it can be only their urls)

Good luck! ðŸ˜Ž
