def send_webpush_notification(students: QuerySet, message: dict):
    """Send a notification on devices, to several students, with one message,
    by creating a celery task in background.

    Parameters
    ----------

    students : QuerySet<Student>
        A queryset of student objects

    message : dict
        A message to send, as a dict, with the structure of the "options"
        parameter of a notification:
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/showNotification
        Please note that title must be placed in the same dict as options in our
        case, for simplicity.
        You can also use the key "hidden": if true, you can send a notification
        to a user but it won't be shown to him (useful for incrementing the
        badge for example).

    Returns
    -------
    task_launched : bool
        Return True if the celery task has been created successfully,
        else False
